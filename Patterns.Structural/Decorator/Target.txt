PROPOSE
* It assigns additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

USE


PROS
- More flexibility than static inheritance. It provides a more flexible way to add responsibilities to objects. It is possible to add and remove responsibilities at runtime.
- Avoid function-laden classes at the top of hierarchies.
- Many small objects. It creates systems formed by many small objects very similar to each other.

CONS
- It can result in a lot of small classes, which could make it difficult to understand
