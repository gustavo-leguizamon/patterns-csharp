* Define the one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when an object changes state, all objects that depend on it are notified and automatically updated.

USE
- When an abstraction has two aspects and one depends on the other.
- When A change in one object requires changing others, and we don't know how many objects need to be changed.
- When an object should be able to notify others without making assumptions about who those objects are.
