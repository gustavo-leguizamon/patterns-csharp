PROPOSE
* Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each of them and make them interchangeable. It allows an algorithm to vary independently of the users who use it.

USE
- When many related classes differ only in their behavior.
- When you want to configure a class with a certain behavior, there are many possible ones.
- When many variants of the same algorithm are needed.
